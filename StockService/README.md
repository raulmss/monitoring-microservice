# üì¶ Stock Service

## üìå Project Overview
The **Stock Service** is a microservice responsible for managing product stock availability. It provides **real-time stock information** to the **Product Service** via inter-service communication using **Spring Cloud OpenFeign**.

---

## üöÄ Technologies Used
- **Java 11 & Spring Boot 2.5.3** ‚Äì Core framework for backend development.
- **Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka Client** ‚Äì Registers the service with Eureka for service discovery.
- **Spring Cloud Sleuth & Zipkin** ‚Äì Provides distributed tracing for request monitoring.
- **Spring Boot Actuator** ‚Äì Adds monitoring capabilities.
- **YAML Configuration** ‚Äì Manages application properties.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The **Stock Service** is part of a **microservices architecture** and is responsible for:
- Storing **stock availability** for different products.
- Providing real-time stock information to the **Product Service** via an **API call**.
- Registering with **Eureka Server** for **service discovery**.
- Enabling **distributed tracing** with **Spring Cloud Sleuth & Zipkin**.

| **Service**          | **Role** |
|----------------------|---------|
| **Stock Service**    | Manages and provides stock availability for products. |
| **Product Service**  | Queries stock availability from Stock Service. |
| **Eureka Server**    | Registers and discovers microservices. |
| **Zipkin**           | Monitors and traces inter-service communication. |

- Eureka Server Running on Ports 8761 & 8762
- Zipkin Tracing Server Running on Port 9411

#### Steps to Run
1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/raulmss/microservices-discovery-1.git
    cd stock-service
